<div id="about-cat">
    <p> The cat <br/> (Felis catus, or Felis silvestris catus, literally "woodland cat")[4][1][5], often referred to as the domestic cat
        to distinguish from other felids and felines, is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. It is often called house cat[6]
        when kept as indoor pet or feral/feral domestic cat when wild.[7] It is often valued by humans for companionship and for its
        ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.
        <h2>anatomy</h2>
        Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws
        adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too
        high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most
        other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters,
        are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing,
        growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[8]

        <em>Cats have a high
            <strong>breeding</strong> rate
        </em>.[9]
    <h3>Controll</h3>
        Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets,
        a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as the abandonment of
        former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.[10] In certain areas
        outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many
        bird species.
    <h1>Birds extirpation</h1>
        Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed to the extinction
        of isolated island populations.[11] Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 87 species of birds,[12]
        and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species
        reintroduction.[13]</p>
